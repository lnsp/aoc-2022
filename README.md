# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains solutions for Advent of Code 2022 in Rust. For most problems, only a single binary is present, although if the second problem presents a major variation on the first problem, there may be a binary called `XXb` (e.g. `03` and `03b`).

> Disclaimer: I'm still very new to Rust and all of this has been solely created for learning purposes. I expect all of the code to have major mistakes in terms of style.

## Usage

To run a solution for the problem of day `XX`, use

```bash
cargo run --bin XX
```
